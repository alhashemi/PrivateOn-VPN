###	Instructions for using your own OpenVPN configuration
###	files with PrivateOn-VPN.
###


#### 		Change constant CUSTOMIZE		####

To use custom ovpn definitions instead of web-published lists, 
change the following line in vpn-gui/vpn_install.pm
from
	CUSTOMIZE    => 0,
to 
	CUSTOMIZE    => 1,

Copy your ovpn-files into /tmp/vpn_install/



####		   File naming guide			####

PrivateOn-VPN uses the ovpn-file's name to identify the vpn-type, 
country iso code and ucp/tcp choice.
If the file name does not meet the following requirements, 
the program will not import that openVPN file 
and it will not be available in the GUI.


The file name is comprised of 4 elements. 
All elements are mandatory. Server number is optional.
The elements are separated using the minus sign “-”.

Allowed keywords:
	Type = 		vpn  /  tor  /  double
	Country = 	lower case ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
				/  ISO  “+” ISO   *
	Server number: 	0 - 9   **
	Comment: 	description of your choosing   ***
	Transport: 	tcp  /  udp

* For country codes see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2

** This field enumerates the servers within a country. 
This field is optional.

*** The comment can include any character except the minus sign “-”.
We also recommend not using dot, space or other escaped characters.


You can use an online regex tool to check your file name.
Here is the regular expression we use to parse the file name:
^(double|tor|vpn)-([a-z][a-z][0-9]?|[a-z][a-z]\+[a-z][a-z][0-9]?)-(.*)-(tcp|udp)\.ovpn$
